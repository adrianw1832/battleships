##Battheships

This project is from the week 2 weekly challenge of the Makers Academy course.
It introduces more advanced concepts of OOP and TDD to us. More focus on clean
code and SOLID principles are also placed. It also teaches us the importance of
breaking down the problem and then starting with an MVP. The player and to a
greater extent, the game class, was not terribly well written, as described
below. On the other hand, I was quite happy with the board class. We did have to
use global variables, which is definitely not ideal, but since we won't be
introduced to database until the next week, it was the only viable substitute.

##Challenges

I found it difficult to work with a new person everyday since it meant agreeing
to work on a new code base every morning. The instructions of this challenge did
not limit us to a particular method of tackling the problem and so each pair
partner had a different way to approach the problem. Whilst this is good in the
sense that I got to see the different approaches in tackling the problem, it
also meant that progress was slow, which is why I created a makeshift player and
game class in the end, since time was not on my side. For a better
implementation of the game and player class, take a look at the Rock, Paper,
Scissor challenge.
